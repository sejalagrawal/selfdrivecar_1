In convolutional neural network, kernel matrix spans over an image and moves in steps through pixels. Step size is called 'stride'
Pixel area where operation is taking place - Receptive field
Kernel acts as feature extractor and the resulting matrix after convolution is called 'feature map'. 
Different kernels extracts different features, based on their weights/values.
Depth of the kernel = depth of image ( eg, for rgb pictures, since there are 3 channels, there would be 3 kernels )
For 2D image ( grayscale ) = kernel is 3 X 3
For 3D image ( rgb ) = kernel is 3 X 3 X 3
Activation function in CNN : ReLU - rectified linear unit
Why sigmoid / tanh is not used -> vanishingg gradient / gradient too small; and in neural network, we depend on gradient to train the system better.
Process of convolution layer :
Image -> 'x' feature matrices -> convolved over the image gives 'x' stack of convoluted images -> ReLU activation function applied -> filtered images
Pooling is used : ( Different types of pooling - max, sum, average )
1)to avoid overfitting, 
2)reduce no of parameters in image, 
3)reduce computation in the network. 
Max pooling provides scaled invariant representation of the image. ( meaning, it takes max value of the neighbourbood, so desired feature extraction is easier )
Kernel in pooling layer is kept small so as not to loose weights of features.
CNN in short :
       Image -> ( Convolution -> pooling )^n -> Fully connected layer -> Output
1st half -> responsible for feature extraction
2nd half -> responsible for classfication.

Steps in Classifying road symbols:
1) Preprocessing










Fundamentals of Self driving cars ( Udacity Course ):
Some new terms and concepts -
1) Frenet coordinates - the 2 axis in this system represents the road. Longitudinal axis - parallel to road, lateral axis - perpendicular to road.
2) Lattice planning consists of 2 steps:
       a) forming SL and ST trajectory ( ST - longitudinal vs time trajectory, SL - longitudinal vs lateral trajectory ie lateral offset wrt longitude)
       b) combine these 2 trajectories
3) 3 options for path planning on road - 
       cruising ( accelertn = 0 , v is constant), 
       following ( v and a - fixed, depending on lead vehicle ) and 
       stop ( v and a = 0 )
 4) To control the vehicels, algo should be accurate, favourable to car and smooth. 3 options :
       a) PID ( Proportional integral derivative control )
       b) LQR ( Linear quadratic regulator ) ( equation looks like x` = Ax + Bu , u =[steering, throttle, break], x=[ lateral error, its @ of change, heading error or angle, its @ of change])
       c) MPC ( Model predictive control)
